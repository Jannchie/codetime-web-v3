## Introduction

This is the third version of Codetime Web. We've gone through iterations from Vue SPA to Next.js and now to Nuxt.js. We've made the switch from ECharts to Observable Plot.

It's consistent with the code running at <https://codetime.dev>.

## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

Locally preview production build:

```bash
pnpm run preview
```

Check out the [deployment documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/deployment) for more information.
